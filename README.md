# **Birthday Gift Website**

# Overview

Welcome to my Birthday Gift Website project! ðŸŽ‰ In celebration of my niece's special day, I've created a delightful online space to share the joy. This website not only showcases her name, photo, and birthday date but also features interactive elements, including a playful gif that animates when hovered over. Each gif is carefully selected to bring a smile to her face, featuring a cartoon character dancing for her birthday,  a teapot joyously celebrating, and a charming gift.
